This work is based on "BDD Minimization for Approximate Computing" by Mathias Soeken, Daniel Gro√üe, Arun Chandrasekharan and Rolf Drechsler, ASP-DAC 2016 : 474-479. It includes an implementation of the approximation operators introduced in the above mentioned paper.

Since the approximation of a BDD is called "rounding" I named this repository after Johann CARL Friedrich Gauss who invented the square bracket notation for the floor (aka the rounding down) function.
